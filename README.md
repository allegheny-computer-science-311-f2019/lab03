# lab03_cs311f2019

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the starter files for Laboratory 2 assignment in Computer Science 311.

## Summary
This laboratory assignment invites you to work in a team to implement an ethical
drone navigation technique for a specific application. 
Using `pyparrot` Python interface for Parrot drones, your designed drone
will complete a specified path plan while recording its path and taking 
images at certain points of its navigation. Your implementation
should include at least two take offs and landings by the drone.
Finally, you are also responsible for writing a detailed report,
stored in the file `writing/reflection.md`. This is a Markdown file that must
adhere to the standards described in the [Markdown Syntax
Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Available for download at the course website [course
website](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/jjumadinova/teaching/311/labs.html),
the carefully formatted assignment sheet for this project provides more details
about the steps that a computer scientist should take to complete this
assignment.

## Learning
To complete the necessary  installations on your machine to work with `pyparrot`, please follow the [pyparrot installation instructions](https://pyparrot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). To learn about the commands you can use on Bebop robots using `pyparrot`, please consult [pyparrot documentation](https://pyparrot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bebopcommands.html).

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub
Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features
that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the
following GitHub guides: [Mastering
Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello
World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your
Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these
guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and
[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).
